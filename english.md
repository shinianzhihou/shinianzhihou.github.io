### [In 5G market, China puts money where its mouth is](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201906/19/WS5d0982aea3103dbf14328fed.html)

That Ericsson and Nokia will become suppliers of 5G equipment for the Chinese market is noteworthy, as it indicates that despite Huawei's leading position in the field, China has opened its door to other 5G equipment providers from around the world.  

Now, the starting gun has been fired, a large-scale 5G infrastructure construction will sweep the country. 

And this will be win-win cooperation coming along with the advancement of technology.

 As long as foreign companies meet relevant requirements, they can compete for orders of the Chinese market through transparent and equal means, and the Chinese government will never disturb normal industrial and business cooperation.

 Although the Chinese enterprises claim more than 30 percent of the patents of 5G standards, they have not taken advantage of their leading position to force out competitors from other countries, as it is a consensus among them that the future of 5G and breakthroughs of the next generation of telecommunications technologies lie in international collaboration, not working behind closed doors.

In stark contrast, the United States has left no stones unturned in its bid to split the world on the research, development and application of a technology that aims to connect the world.
