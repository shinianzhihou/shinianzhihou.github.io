That Ericsson and Nokia will become suppliers of 5G equipment for the Chinese market is noteworthy, as it indicates that despite Huawei's leading position in the field, China has opened its door to other 5G equipment providers from around the world.  

Now, the starting gun has been fired, a large-scale 5G infrastructure construction will sweep the country. 

The return is even more remarkable, as the economic output that the commercial use of 5G will directly bring about from 2020 to 2025 is forecast to total 10.6 trillion yuan.

And this will be win-win cooperation coming along with the advancement of technology.
