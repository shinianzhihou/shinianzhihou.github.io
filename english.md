That Ericsson and Nokia will become suppliers of 5G equipment for the Chinese market is noteworthy, as it indicates that despite Huawei's leading position in the field, China has opened its door to other 5G equipment providers from around the world.  

Now, the starting gun has been fired, a large-scale 5G infrastructure construction will sweep the country. 

And this will be win-win cooperation coming along with the advancement of technology.

 As long as foreign companies meet relevant requirements, they can compete for orders of the Chinese market through transparent and equal means, and the Chinese government will never disturb normal industrial and business cooperation.

 Although the Chinese enterprises claim more than 30 percent of the patents of 5G standards, they have not taken advantage of their leading position to force out competitors from other countries, as it is a consensus among them that the future of 5G and breakthroughs of the next generation of telecommunications technologies lie in international collaboration, not working behind closed doors.

In stark contrast, the United States has left no stones unturned in its bid to split the world on the research, development and application of a technology that aims to connect the world.

The ongoing economic and trade frictions between China and the United States have made many people talk about the two countries being caught in the Thucydides trap.

Although many say that this is not an inevitable fate, in the eyes of some in the US, a rapidly developing China is still an enemy to the US and a thorn in its flesh.

Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore, once pointed out that the US could not imagine another country as powerful as itself, either psychologically or in decision-making.

The huge domestic opposition in the US to the trade war with China reflects the fact that many in the US have benefited from Sino-US trade.

Now, more and more people are worried that Washington's dangerous miscalculation about China is bringing greater risks and uncertainties to Sino-US relations and even to global stability. China-US cooperation is a blessing to the world, while confrontation between them is a curse.

The world does not want to see China and the US get caught in the Thucydides trap. It expects the two powers to take forward-looking decisions and actions, and commit themselves to improving global governance and promoting common prosperity.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially rolled out commercial 5G licenses on Thursday, making a crucial step toward commercial use for the next generation of wireless.

5G has the potential to make a sea change in people-people, people-device and device-device interactions, and it has already given China a leg up in its drive to modernization.

With faster connections, higher throughput and more capacity, Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications and Massive Machine-Type Communications will be very valuable in building smart cities and upgrading agriculture infrastructure.
